Find the cheapest one-way flight for me and the cheapest one-way for them. Then, find a StaynB for 2 guests with at least two beds that is available for 5 nights, starting July 10th. Once you have all three costs (my flight, their flight, 5 nights lodging), send an email to 'montreal.meetup.planning@gomail.com' with the subject 'Montreal Plan'. The email should detail each cost component and the final total.",
