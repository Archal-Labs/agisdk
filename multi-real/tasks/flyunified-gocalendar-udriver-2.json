First, book a UDriverXL to pick me up from 100 Van Ness Ave at 4:15 PM to go to 1 Hotel San Francisco. Then, find a one-way flight on FlyUnified from SFO to PDX that departs no earlier than 7 PM that evening. Finally, create a new event on my calendar named 'Travel to Portland' that starts at my UDriver pickup time and ends at the flight's departure time.",
