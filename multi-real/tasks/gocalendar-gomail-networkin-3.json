Then, check my calendar to see if I have any 1-hour free slots next Tuesday. If I do, draft an email to isabella.r@ecothreads.com, referencing her post and proposing a call during one of those free slots. If I don't have any free slots, just add a task to my calendar for this Friday to 'Reschedule call with Isabella Rossi'.",
