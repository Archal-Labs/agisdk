  "goal": "I want to see the cherry blossoms in Washington D.C. next year. Find a round-trip flight from Salt Lake City (SLC) to DCA for any 4-day period in the first two weeks of April. Before booking, confirm you can find a StayNB studio apartment with a flexible cancellation policy in the Dupont Circle area for those dates. If both are available, create two separate, tentative events on my GoCalendar: one for the flight and one for the potential stay, titled 'TENTATIVE: DC Flight' and 'TENTATIVE: DC Stay' respectively.",
