  "goal": "I need to plan a last-minute getaway to Miami, Florida for this coming weekend. First, check OpenDining to see if there's any availability for two at 'Joe's Stone Crab' for dinner on Saturday night. If there is, book it. Then, find a one-bedroom apartment on StaynB that's within a 10-minute drive of the restaurant. Finally, send an email to 'trip-alerts@gomail.com' with the subject 'Miami Trip GO' containing the reservation and booking confirmations.",
