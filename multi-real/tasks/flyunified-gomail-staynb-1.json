  "goal": "My team is considering two locations for our offsite in September: London or Berlin. Find the cheapest round-trip flight from Denver (DEN) to London (LHR) for the first week of September (1st to 8th). Then, find the cheapest round-trip flight from DEN to Berlin (BER) for the same dates. For both cities, find a well-rated StaynB that can host 4 people for that week. Finally, email a summary to offsite-planning@mycompany.com with the subject 'Offsite Cost Comparison' and list the total cost (flight + 7 nights of lodging) for each city.",
